                        <h2>What does lalalaoutpick stands for?</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>It comes with two parts. "Lalala" means queer women hand in hand to pick litter up, which also derives from the mandarin pronunciation of "拉垃啦".  "OutPick" simply means go out and pick litter up.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>On a typical outpick day, we walk on a trail and pick litter up, that easy! We have recycling bags, litter pickers, and gloves to help you gather rubbish. In any case, if you don't want to do litter-picking, we also welcome you to join us just for a walk in nature.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>We provide litter bags and pickers, gloves, sanitisers, UV protection hats and sunscreen. So you don't need to bring any specific equipment for litter-picking. But do remember to bring your own water or any snack. Also, if you want to use your own sunscreen, please feel free to do so.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Normally, we start off our event at 11 or 11:30 am. It runs 2-3 hours and so we finish around 3 pm. Sometimes if we head to regional areas and have picnic after, it would run 1-2 hours longer.</p>

                        <p>Yes, you are free to bring your women friends and 100% welcome to do so. However, please note that Lalala OutPick is just for queer women and women-identifying individuals.</p>

                        <p>Our litter-picking events are children-friendly. However, be aware of the weather, outdoor and rural area hazards and conditions may not suit children. Let us know in advance will help.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>We are always open for carpooling. If you don't have a vehicle or just want to reduce your carbon emission, feel free to ask in our group chat. We organise carpooling every time before our events. You can also fill out our registration form here so we can prioritise your carpooling preferences.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Our events are completely free and do not charge any fee for litter-picking or carpooling. However, sometimes if we go to regional areas, we will have donation sessions for incentives to our car drivers as petrol is high. Be noted for indoor sessions like bouldering or cinema, the venues require admission for entrance.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>We take photos as our regular practice to record our events, and archive the litter-environment data at each location. We use event photos for our website content, social media posts, and other non-commercial uses including media release, and future grant application with councils or government bodies (we need funding to keep this group running). If you do not want to be photographed, please let us know on site. We will also verbally inform people and also put it on the sign-up notice in the group chat.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>The No.1 priority is people’s safety. As a litter-picking group walking outside, there are potential safety risks in the outdoor space. Participants should be responsible for their own safety as Lalala OutPick is a non-for-profit group and we do not charge people for attending events.
We provide hand sanitisers and gloves during our events to maintain hygiene and health. Our litter bags and pickers will be sprayed after each session.</p>
