        <p class="divider">——</p>
        <p id="our_story">Litter picking is the most achievable and accessible thing we can do for our environment.<br>We regard our beautiful landscape and value the unique Australian flora and fauna.<br>
        <br>We want to connect and encourage queer women and women-identifying allies from<br>diverse backgrounds to see the environment where we are, appreciate the beauty of<br>nature, learn environmental conservation, socialise with like-minded people, to find a<br>sense of belonging within the community by litter picking.<br>
        <br>Lalala OutPick is a not-for-profit organisation. We facilitate monthly litter picking events<br>around Victoria. We encourage people to join us.</p>

                <h3>Jing Yang | co-lead</h3>
                <p>Jing is a people enthusiast and a budding trash queen.<br>She has a vision to transform the language of waste<br>into valuable materials, transform the linear system<br>which is currently 'take-make-dispose' into a circular<br>economy, a closed loop system of things. She believes<br>waste is purely human invention and there is no such<br>thing as waste in nature, everything has its value.</p>

                <h3>Lesley Le Luo | co-lead</h3>
                <p>Lesley is a PhD candidate and uni tutor in digital media<br>and screen culture. She is trying to figure out the use of<br>digital media in relation to queer women's<br>representation and identity formation. Lesley believes<br>that human mobility is the reason we waste our<br>environment, but also the solution to save it. She is also<br>an emerging filmmaker and occasionally makes short<br>films focusing on queer women representation.</p>
